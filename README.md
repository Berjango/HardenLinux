Unfortunately I have had to almost stop updating this software to make life easier for myself and family. Giving hackers the source code to my security software makes things too difficult for me.
Hopefully the software can serve as a basis for someone else on their cyber security journey.




Please note,this is currently experimental as I don't fully understand all the settings and things being done.USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY TESTED BY ME.


Due to ongoing development ,at times the latest code may be broken but the intention is always to correct the mistakes so try again later. It is
normal for not all of the code to execute correctly.

I will attempt to improve it with time.So far I have not noticed any problems with basic use including web browsing,emails and bitorrent,music streaming,videos and file browsing.
I have noticed very significant improvement in system performance,especially web browsing.I mainly use it with Linux Mint but it could be modified for other distributions.


Please note,this is intended for use with a live system,which means one running from a DVD or write protected flash drive. This program is 100% useless for use with a HDD or SSD.Once your files are modified on SSD or HDD ,
it is extremely difficult to save your system and in most cases a reinstallation is required and then it just gets hacked again and you are back at the start.

Many ideas obtained from various websites,although many that are around are unreliable allegedly so be careful.Ideas also from observation,official documentationa,personal experience,reading books and basic logic.

A very simple shell script designed to improve the security of a growing number of live linux systems that are intended for very basic use.

To run

DISTRIBUTION  :               COMMAND
------------------------------------------------------
Mint           :             sh hardenlinuxmint,
debian         :             sh hardenlinuxdeb,
garuda         :             sh hardenlinuxgaruda,
bodhi          :              sh hardenlinuxbodhi,
parrot          :            sh hardenlinuxparrot,
ubuntu          :            sh hardenlinuxubuntu,
------------------------------------------------------
Maybe there is something already that does this and is better but I couldn't find it and maybe I am not very good at this but this program has been useful for me.
I hope it will be useful for others.

This script is designed to be useful for me and won't be appropriate for everyone.It can be modified to suit.

Not all the commands will execute correctly and that is fine.More security measures and linux distributions will be added in time.
The scripts are constantly changing and some things may break and or go untested.

LICENSE - not sure,need advice as I am using a modified Linux system files and have copied stuff.Probably the same license as Linux itself.
