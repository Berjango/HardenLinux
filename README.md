Please note,this is currently experimental as I don't fully understand all the settings and things being done.USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY TESTED BY ME.

THIS IS AN ONGOING EXPERIMENT

I will attempt to improve it with time.So far I have not noticed any problems with basic use including web browsing,emails and bitorrent.
I have noticed very significant improvement in system performance,especially web browsing.

Many ideas obtained from

https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server

and various other websites.Ideas also from observation,official documentationa,personal experience and basic logic.

A very simple shell script designed to improve the security of a debain based or similar live linux system that is intended for basic use.

Run " sh hardenlinux" just after the system starts
Maybe there is something already that does this and is better but I couldn't find it and maybe I am not very good at this but this program has been useful for me.
I hope it will be useful for others.

This script is designed to be useful for me and won't be appropriate for everyone.It can be modified to suit.

Not all the commands will execute correctly and that is fine.More security measures will be added in time.


LICENSE - not sure,need advice as I am using a modified Linux system file and have copied stuff.
