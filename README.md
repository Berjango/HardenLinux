Please note,this is currently experimental as I don't fully understand all the settings and things being done.USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
HAS NOT BEEN EXTENSIVELY TESTED BY ME.

I will attempt to improve it with time.So far I have not noticed any problems with basic use including web browsing,emails and bitorrent,music streaming,videos and file browsing.
I have noticed very significant improvement in system performance,especially web browsing.I mainly use it with Linux Mint but it could be modified for other distributions.

Many ideas obtained from various websites,although many that are around are unreliable allegedly so be careful.Ideas also from observation,official documentationa,personal experience,reading books and basic logic.

A very simple shell script designed to improve the security of a growing number of live linux systems that are intended for very basic use.

To run

DISTRIBUTION  :               COMMAND
------------------------------------------------------
Mint           :             sh hardenlinuxmint,
debian         :             sh hardenlinuxdeb,
garuda         :             sh hardenlinuxgaruda,
------------------------------------------------------
Maybe there is something already that does this and is better but I couldn't find it and maybe I am not very good at this but this program has been useful for me.
I hope it will be useful for others.

This script is designed to be useful for me and won't be appropriate for everyone.It can be modified to suit.

Not all the commands will execute correctly and that is fine.More security measures and linux distributions will be added in time.
The scripts are constantly changing and some things may break and or go untested.

LICENSE - not sure,need advice as I am using a modified Linux system files and have copied stuff.Probably the same license as Linux itself.
