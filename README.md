A shell script designed to improve the security of a debain based or similar live linux system.

Run it just after the system starts
Maybe there is something already that does this and is better but I couldn't find it and maybe I am not very good at this but this program has been useful for me.
I hope it will be useful for others.

Not all the commands will execute correctly and that is fine.More security measures will be added in time.
